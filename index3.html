        <h1>Ruka x AADHum</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Ruka, and I was a fellow in the AADHum Summer 2024 Fellowship Program.<br><br>
            Entering this space, I had no clear picture of where this journey would take me, but I can confidently say that seeds were planted and nurtured in ways I couldn’t have imagined. The African American Digital Humanities Lab became a pivotal experience that every African American scholar should have. It didn’t just change the way I approach my work—it fundamentally transformed my mindset.<br><br>
            At a time when my frontal lobe is undergoing crucial development, AADHum has shown me that I am more capable than I ever realized. I can read, write, print, sew, and exist in multiple realities and forms. I’ve learned to communicate with large audiences, take initiative, and no longer feel constrained by doubts like “I probably need help” or the reliance on others to figure things out. The independence and confidence I’ve gained are priceless.<br><br>
            My journey began with inventory management and evolved into the prototyping of a cultural piece for my community. This experience taught me that imagining is only the beginning—I can now bring those visions to life using the resources and knowledge I’ve gained through AADHum. Where some might say, “I can only imagine what’s next,” I know that I can do more than imagine—I can create it. This program has equipped me to transform my ideas into reality, and I’m ready to continue doing just that.
